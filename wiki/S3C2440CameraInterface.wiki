= Introduction =
*CAMIF (CAMera InterFace)* within the S3C2440A consists of 7 parts 
	* pattern mux
	* capturing unit
	* preview scaler
	* codec scaler
	* preview DMA
	* codec DMA
	* SFR.

* The CAMIF supports ITU-R BT.601/656 YCbCr 8-bit standard. 

* Maximum input size is 4096x4096 pixels (2048x2048 pixels for scaling) and two scalers exist. 

* Preview scaler is dedicated to generate smaller size image like PIP (Picture In Picture) 

* codec scaler is dedicated to generate codec useful image like plane type YCbCr 4:2:0 or 4:2:2.

* Two master DMAs can do mirror and rotate the captured image for mobile environments. 

*TWO DMA PATHS*

CAMIF has 2 DMA paths. P-path (Preview path) and C-path (Codec path) are separated from each other on the
AHB bus. 


* In view of the system bus, both the paths are independent. 

* The P-path stores the RGB image data intomemory for PIP. 

* The C-path stores the YCbCr 4:2:0 or 4:2:2 image data into memory for Codec as MPEG-4, H.263,etc. 


*FRAME MEMORY HIRERARCHY*

Frame memories consist of four ping-pong memories for each of P and C paths .

C-path ping-pong memories have three element memories â€“ luminance Y, chrominance Cb, and chrominance Cr.

If AHB-bus traffic is not enough for the DMA operation to complete during one horizontal line period, it may lead to malfunctioning

*MEMORY STORING METHOD*

The little-endian method in codec path is used to store in the frame memory. The pixels are stored from LSB to MSB
side. 

AHB bus carries 32-bit word data. So, CAMIF makes each of the Y-Cb-Cr words in little-endian style. 

For preview path, two different formats exist. One pixel (Color 1 pixel) is one word for RGB 24-bit format. Otherwise, 
two pixels are one word for RGB 16-bit format.
