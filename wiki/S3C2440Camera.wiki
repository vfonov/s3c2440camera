= Interface =

The *CAMIF*, also the Camera Interface block is the hardware block that interfaces with different image sensors and provides a standard output that can be used for subsequent image processing.

A typical *Camera Interface* would support at least a parallel interface although these days many camera interfaces are beginning to support the Mobile Industry Processor Interface MIPI CSI interface. 

The camera interface's parallel interface consists of the following lines :-

*8 to 12 bits parallel data line*
:These are parallel data lines that carry pixel data. The data transmitted on these lines change with every Pixel Clock (PCLK).

*Horizontal Sync (HSYNC)*
:This is a special signal that goes from the camera sensor or ISP to the camera interface. An HSYNC indicates that one line of the frame is transmitted.

*Vertical Sync (VSYNC)*
:This signal is transmitted after the entire frame is transferred. This signal is often a way to indicate that one entire frame is transmitted.

*Pixel Clock (PCLK)*
:This is the pixel clock and it would change on every pixel.

*NOTE*: The above lines are all treated as input lines to the Camera Interface hardware.

= Pixel Formats =

There are different methods for representing color and intensity information in a video image. The video format that a file uses to store this information is also known as the *pixel format*

There are two major types of pixel formats. They are classified as YUV and RGB pixel formats.
